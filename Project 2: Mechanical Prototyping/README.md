# Project 2: Mechanical Prototyping

**ECE118 - Introduction to Mechatronics**  
**University of California, Santa Cruz**  
**Spring 2024**  

## 📌 Overview

Project 2 focuses on mechanical prototyping, and designing and building a robot chassis using **SolidWorks**, **laser cutting**, and **foamcore construction**. Additionally, we improved the **beacon detector circuit** from Project 1, implementing it on perfboard for use in future projects.

### 🔹 Objectives:
- Gain experience in **SolidWorks** for mechanical design
- Learn **laser cutting** and **foamcore construction**
- Assemble a **simple gearbox** as a design exercise
- Design and prototype a **motorized platform**
- Improve and solder the **beacon detector circuit** for reliable operation

## ⚙️ Technologies & Components

- **Software:** SolidWorks, EAGLE, MPLAB X IDE
- **Hardware:** MDF, foamcore, motors, H-bridge, IR sensors
- **Tools:** Laser cutter, soldering iron, oscilloscope, multimeter
